#Data analysis for airlines delays
Well this is a assignment work for data lit.
ln this i have used formatted_data.csv file to get insights of arrival delays.
So first import pandas library  and then show the first 10 rows of data to get an idea about the data.
Then import the matplotlib.pyplot library and seaborn as plt and sns.
Then use the hist func to plot a histogram and set the bins to 180/5,i.e.,equal to 36 to get a less messy data.
Set kde equals to false to not display the density curve in hist plot.
